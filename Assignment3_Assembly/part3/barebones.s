					# (1) What are we setting up here?

	pushq %rbp			#
	movq  %rsp, %rbp		#

					# (2) What is going on here
					# Ans:
	movq $1, %rax			# 
	movq $1, %rdi			#
	leaq .hello.str,%rsi		#


					# (3) What is syscall? We did not talk about this

					# Ans:
	syscall				# Which syscall is being run?
					# Ans:

					# (4) What would another option be instead of 
					# using a syscall to achieve this?
					# Ans:

	movq	$60, %rax		# (5) We are again setting up another syscall
	movq	$0, %rdi		# What command is it?
					# Ans:	
	syscall

	popq %rbp			# (Note we do not really need
					# this command here after the syscall)
